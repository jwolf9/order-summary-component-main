## My process

### Built with

- CSS
- HTML
- Sass
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to format background images. How to make the image not repeat and add colors for a filtered effect

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
body {
  background-image: url(../images/pattern-background-desktop.svg);
  background-color: $pale-blue;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: 100%;
}
```

### Continued development

Want to get more comfortable with the Flexbox model and positioning elements
